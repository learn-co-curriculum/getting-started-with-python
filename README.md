## Introduction

With a good understanding of both Ruby and JavaScript, you've gone through the process of
learning a new language _twice_ already. We recommend you continue to improve the
understanding of these two languages - a clear depth of knowledge on one or two languages is
often more advantageous than knowing a little about many languages. You're also already past the
major hurdles of learning Ruby and JavaScript and can grasp more advanced concepts in these langauges.

However, depending on your career goals and the opportunities available to you, having an understanding
of a third popular programming language can help.

One of the most popular languages currently is [Python][] and its popularity
continues to rise. Like Ruby, you can use Python to build a backend for a full-stack application. Similar to
Ruby on Rails, Python has a couple of web frameworks for making it easier to spin up projects: [Django][] and
[Flask][]

Python is also widely used in other fields such as data science. Having some familiarity in the language
can help you stand out as a candidate.

## Where to Start Learning Python

There are many free resources online for learning Python. We recommend first checking out the documentation
available at [python.org](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) to get setup. After you've got
everything setup take a look around for tutorials that fit your needs. [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python][]
is a good comprehensive resource, but there are many other free options that can be found with a quick Google
search.
